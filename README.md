Basics of OOP programming on JS. 

DESCRIPTION

Today, you will continue this learning path by getting up close and personal with object-oriented programming.The OOP model of programming is centered around data, rather than 
functions and procedures.It uses objects, which can be described as containers of data that have unique characteristics and behaviors. When data is organized into objects, code 
becomes a lot more readable,scalable, and functional.The key principles of OOP include, but are not limited to,

•encapsulation
•polymorphism
•inheritance

Don't worry if these words mean nothing to you at this point, you will make sense of themonce you get some experience using the OOP approach. Without further ado, let's get 
started.
